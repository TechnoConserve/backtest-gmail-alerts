# backtest-gmail-alerts

A hacky script to parse past gmail messages so as to gather ticker symbols, dates, signals, and price levels
to facilitate back testing with said symbols.

alert_parse.py can be run by itself...

...or instantiated elsewhere as an object which is what symbol_set.py helps to test.
